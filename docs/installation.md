# Installing Thanos Operator

Currently, this is a single mode of installing Thanos Operator, which is through YAML manifests!

## Pre-requisites

For all the approaches listed on this page, you require access to a Kubernetes cluster! For this, you can check the official docs of Kubernetes available [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

## Install using YAML files

The first step is to install the operatorâ€™s Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) as well as the operator itself with the required RBAC resources.

We've packaged all of them into a neat bundle for you! Run the command below to fetch and apply that bundle. This will install the CRDs, apply RBAC and deploy the operator binary in the `thanos-operator-system` namespace.

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thanos-community/thanos-operator/refs/heads/main/bundle.yaml | kubectl create -f -
```

If you would like to install the operator in a different namespace, you can use [Kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/) to do so,

```bash
NAMESPACE=my_namespace
TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thanos-community/thanos-operator/refs/heads/main/kustomization.yaml > "$TMPDIR/kustomization.yaml"
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thanos-community/thanos-operator/refs/heads/main/bundle.yaml > "$TMPDIR/bundle.yaml"
(cd $TMPDIR && kustomize edit set namespace $NAMESPACE) && kubectl create -k "$TMPDIR"
```

It can take some time for the operator to be up and running. You can wait for operator pods to become ready via,

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/component=manager,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=thanos-operator,control-plane=controller-manager \
  -n thanos-operator-system \
  --timeout=2m
```

You should now be able to create CRs!

## Create Custom Resources

You can take a look at the sample CRs we have within this repo in `config/samples`

To use those samples, you can run the following. This will create a [MinIO](https://min.io/) object storage and deploy the relevant Thanos component CRs in a [Receive-based](https://thanos.io/tip/components/receive.md/) setup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thanos-community/thanos-operator.git
kubectl config use-context <YOUR-CLUSTER>
make install-example
```
