## Overview

The Thanos Operator provides Kubernetes native deployment and management of Thanos components. The purpose of this project is to simplify and automate the configuration of a Thanos based monitoring stack that would work across different topologies and deployment modes.

The Thanos operator includes, but is not limited to, the following features:

* **Kubernetes Custom Resources**: For Thanos Receive, Thanos Ruler, Thanos Store Gateway, Thanos Compactor and Thanos Querier. For Thanos Sidecar, please use [Prometheus CRD](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/api-reference/api/#monitoring.coreos.com/v1.Prometheus) from Prometheus-Operator.

* **Simplified Deployment Configuration**: Configure fundamental and advanced topologies wth simplified CRDs that can be composed into architecture of your choice.

* **Extensability with multi-cluster technologies**: Shares Thanos' philosophy of operating in multi-cluster environments. Provides extensible configuration so that you can easily manage Thanos installation with other multi-cluster technologies/initiatives like custom operators or [Open Cluster Management](https://open-cluster-management.io/).

For more details, read how to [get started](#getting-started) and explore our [CRD docs](./docs/api.md)

## Usage

We publish images from each commit to main and per-release at https://quay.io/thanos/thanos-operator

Thanos Operator binary CLI Options include,

```bash mdox-exec="./bin/manager --help"
Usage of ./bin/manager:
  -enable-http2
    	If set, HTTP/2 will be enabled for the metrics and webhook servers
  -feature-gate.enable-service-monitors
    	If set, the operator will manage ServiceMonitors for Prometheus Operator (default true)
  -health-probe-bind-address string
    	The address the probe endpoint binds to. (default ":8081")
  -kubeconfig string
    	Paths to a kubeconfig. Only required if out-of-cluster.
  -leader-elect
    	Enable leader election for controller manager. Enabling this will ensure there is only one active controller manager.
  -metrics-bind-address string
    	The address the metric endpoint binds to. (default ":8080")
  -metrics-secure
    	If set the metrics endpoint is served securely
  -zap-devel
    	Development Mode defaults(encoder=consoleEncoder,logLevel=Debug,stackTraceLevel=Warn). Production Mode defaults(encoder=jsonEncoder,logLevel=Info,stackTraceLevel=Error) (default true)
  -zap-encoder value
    	Zap log encoding (one of 'json' or 'console')
  -zap-log-level value
    	Zap Level to configure the verbosity of logging. Can be one of 'debug', 'info', 'error', or any integer value > 0 which corresponds to custom debug levels of increasing verbosity
  -zap-stacktrace-level value
    	Zap Level at and above which stacktraces are captured (one of 'info', 'error', 'panic').
  -zap-time-encoding value
    	Zap time encoding (one of 'epoch', 'millis', 'nano', 'iso8601', 'rfc3339' or 'rfc3339nano'). Defaults to 'epoch'.
```

CRDs supported by this operator are defined in [./config/crd/bases](./config/crd/bases/). Operator deployment manifests are defined in [./config/manager](./config/manager/). To edit and build configuration refer to [CRD docs](./docs/api.md).

## Getting Started

To install CRDs run,

```bash
make install
```

To deploy operator run,

```bash
make deploy IMG="<IMAGE_NAME>"
```

IMAGE_NAME here is usually `example.com/thanos-operator:v0.0.1` for testing/local and `quay.io/thanos/thanos-operator:main-YYYY-MM-DD-COMMIT` (can reference latest from [quay](https://quay.io/thanos/thanos-operator))

To deploy [example manifests](./config/samples/), which give you a local [MinIO](https://min.io/) object storage instance and Thanos installation in Receive architecture, run,

```bash
make install-example
```

### Interactive Demo

To test out the operator with a local Kubernetes cluster you can run an interactive demo in KinD. You will firstly need to install [mage](https://magefile.org/) and then run the following commands:

```bash
mage interactiveDemo
```

Once the workloads are ready, run `kubectl -n thanos-operator-system port-forward svc/thanos-query-frontend-example-query 9090` and visit `http://localhost:9090` to via the query UI.

This demo consists of a Prometheus, deployed via Prometheus Operator, that scrapes metrics from the operator and the Thanos components themselves. It remote writes to the Thanos Receive component.

## Contributing and development

Requirements to build, and test the project,

```
Go 1.22+
Linux or macOS
KinD 
kubectl
```

You can read about our goals and design decisions [here](./docs/DESIGN.md)!

Any contributions are welcome! Just use GitHub Issues and Pull Requests as usual. We follow [Thanos Go coding style guide](https://thanos.io/tip/contributing/coding-style-guide.md/).

## Testing

The following `make` targets are available for testing:

1. `make test` - Runs unit and integration tests.
2. `make test-e2e` - Runs e2e tests against a Kubernetes cluster.

When executing integration tests, the following environment variables can be used to skip specific, per-controller tests:
* EXCLUDE_COMPACT=true
* EXCLUDE_QUERY=true
* EXCLUDE_RULER=true
* EXCLUDE_RECEIVE=true
* EXCLUDE_STORE=true

As an example, to run only integration tests for ThanosStore, you can run the following command:

```bash
EXCLUDE_COMPACT=true EXCLUDE_QUERY=true EXCLUDE_RULER=true EXCLUDE_RECEIVE=true make test
```
