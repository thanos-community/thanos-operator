Thanos follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). Additionally our team members can be contacted directly for code of conduct abuse, as described below.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team members (e.g @saswatamcode, @philipgough) at [CNCF slack workspace](https://slack.cncf.io/). The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/)
