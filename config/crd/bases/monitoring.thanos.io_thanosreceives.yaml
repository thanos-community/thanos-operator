                        reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
                        Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
                        and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
                        The value should be a CamelCase string.
                        This field may not be empty.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
                        The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)
